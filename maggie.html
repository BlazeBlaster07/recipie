    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of Maggi noodles</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups of water</li>
        <li>Maggi tastemaker (included in the pack)</li>
        <li>Optional add-ons: vegetables (carrot, peas, capsicum), an egg, cheese, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water: Pour 1 ½ cups of water into a pan and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add noodles: Once the water is boiling, add the Maggi noodles (break them if you prefer shorter strands)</li>
        <li>Add tastemaker: Add the Maggi tastemaker that comes with the pack into the boiling noodles.</li>
        <li>Cook: Let the noodles cook for 2 minutes while stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li>Optional add-ons: If you're adding veggies, put them in with the noodles. If adding an egg, you can beat it and add it at this point. You can also sprinkle some cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the water is absorbed and the noodles are cooked, serve hot.</li>
